# Show the Local Weather

## Objective
Build an app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.

## Requirements
* User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

* User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

* User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## Notes
I have used: 

* CSS Flexbox for layout.

* jQuery for API calls. 

* Fontawesome for icons. 

* Openweather API

## View Project
